# IoT_Platform
This is a project to track a stream of data generated by temperature sensors to pass throughout a whole IoT platform consisting of three layers.

## Layer 1
This layer talks direclty with the hardware -- in this case: Raspberry Pi with a temp. sensor

the application here is either a python script "dummy_generator" that simulates the hardware or "temp.py" which a script used on the Pi to get the values.

## Layer 2
This layer has a java application. The application builds two connectors:
1. Kafka-Flink connector --- demonstrated in 2 classes.
2. Kafka-Flink-Elasticsearch --- extends the flow by connecting the stream to an Elastic Search node.

## Layer 3
Web services to get the data from the ES cluster.
